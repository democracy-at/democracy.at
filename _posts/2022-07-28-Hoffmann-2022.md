# Freedom for You

My name is Oliver Hoffmann and I am running for president of Austria.
When I elected I will:

* allow zero party representatives in the next government
* have zero backdoor talks with party bosses

## reign in corrupt mass media

* allow zero government ads in mass media
* have zero tolerance for media leaks
* allow zero government media campaigns

## control the government

* ensure quality management for government action instead of political actionism via narrative management
* initiate fewer, but better laws and bylaws
* ensure equal rights and equal responsibility for all
* reduce unaccountable and/or semi-official entities and "expert" committees

## increase your agency

* ensure more free choice in all areas of life
* create more transparency and participation in all stages of political decision making
* advocate for more direct democracy

## increase your economic wellbeing

* reduce taxes
* reduce government bureaucracy
* ensure more freedom and more free space for human growth
