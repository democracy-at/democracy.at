# Agile Democracy

Austria's political institutuions have largely failed the test over the Covid years.
So we are disrupting the political process by combining political consensus building with modern management methods for knowledge work:

1. Any political action has to be vetted in an open an transparent process before being considered for implementation.
2. Modern knowledge work is based on agile management methods. First, ownership and accountability have to be established, any hierarchy of decision making has be based on that.
